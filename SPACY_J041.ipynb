I know that many people view the HP 49 G ( now 49G+ ) as the flagship of the HP line , but for me that was a disaster . The 49 G may be powerful , but using it is extremely counterintuitive ... and the manual was sketchy at best .   The 12C , on the other hand , does what I need in a way that makes good sense to me . If you are looking for a solid , reliable calculator , the HP12C may be for you .   It 's programmable .   It does basic statistics well , and many business applications too .   The manual makes sense ; you will be up and running in short order . I'm ready to set my 49 G aside and move back to my old friend .
